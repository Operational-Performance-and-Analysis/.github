## Overview of Team
* Each repository contains 
  - all information related to the project. I.e., each repo has a modular design, and
  - detailed documentation on the front page's `README.md` file.
* You can search **key topics** like `labor` to find all repositories relating to labor.
* Repositories with `Private Archive` tags means that they are no longer used, or archived. GitHub prevents editing within these repositories.
